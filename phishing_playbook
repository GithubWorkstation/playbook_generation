1.Preparation:
Educate employees regularly on the recognition of phishing attempts and the importance of security best practices. Establish a clear protocol for reporting suspected phishing attempts[6].
2.Identification:
Encourage employees to report suspicious emails or communications. Use email filtering tools to detect and flag potential phishing emails based on known patterns and indicators[5].
3.Containment:
Upon identification, isolate the affected systems to prevent the spread of the attack. Disable compromised accounts and temporarily block any malicious IP addresses involved in the attack[3].
4.Eradication:
Remove phishing emails from affected inboxes and conduct a thorough scan of any impacted systems to remove malicious payloads or software. Reset passwords and security settings where necessary[3].
5.Recovery:
Restore data from backups if necessary. Ensure all systems are clean before reconnecting them to the network and restoring normal operations[1].
6.Post-Incident Analysis:
Review the incident to identify how the attack succeeded and update policies and protocols to strengthen defenses against future attacks. Provide additional training to employees if needed[4].
