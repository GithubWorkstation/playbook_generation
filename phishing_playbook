1.Identification and Initial Assessment:
Monitor and identify suspected phishing emails or links using automated tools. Employees should be trained to report suspicious emails promptly.
Initial analysis to confirm if it's a phishing attack should be conducted by IT security teams[2].
2.Containment:
Temporarily block the suspected sources (email addresses, URLs) of the phishing attack at the network level to prevent further spread.
Isolate affected systems to minimize the risk of sensitive data breaches[3].
3.Eradication:
Remove phishing emails from all affected inboxes and ensure that any malware delivered via the phishing attack is also removed using appropriate tools[3].
4.Recovery:
Restore systems and data from clean backups if necessary. Monitor the affected systems for signs of abnormal activity to ensure no remnants of the attack remain.
Gradually reintegrate the cleaned systems into the network[1].
5.Post-Incident Review and Policy Update:
Conduct a thorough review of the incident to determine the attack vector and any organizational vulnerabilities that were exploited.
Update security policies and response strategies based on lessons learned to strengthen defenses against future attacks[4].
