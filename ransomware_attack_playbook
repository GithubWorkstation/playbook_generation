1.Preparation and Prevention:
Conduct regular training sessions for staff on recognizing and preventing ransomware attacks. Ensure that all critical systems are backed up frequently and that backups are stored securely offline[2].
2.Identification:
Implement advanced monitoring tools to detect unusual activity and identify potential ransomware attacks early. Ensure that all system logs are reviewed regularly for signs of intrusion[4].
3.Containment:
Isolate affected systems immediately to prevent the spread of ransomware. Disconnect infected systems from the network and disable wireless functionalities[5].
4.Eradication:
Remove the ransomware from all infected systems using trusted and updated anti-malware tools. Ensure that all malware traces are removed before reconnecting systems to the network[5].
5.Recovery:
Restore affected systems from clean backups after confirming the removal of ransomware. Test restored systems to ensure they are fully functional and monitor them for any signs of issues[5].
6.Post-Incident Analysis and Reporting:
Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the source of the attack and assess the impact. Update incident response plans and security measures based on the findings. Report the incident to relevant authorities as required by regulatory standards[1].
7.Continuous Improvement:
Review and update security policies and response strategies regularly. Use lessons learned from the incident to enhance resilience against future attacks[3].
