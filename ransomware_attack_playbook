1.Preparation and Training:
Ensure all critical systems are regularly backed up and that backups are stored offline. Train staff on ransomware detection and safe practices for email and browsing[2].
2.Identification:
Detect the ransomware as soon as possible through monitoring tools and alerts. This includes identifying the type of ransomware and the systems that are affected[4].
3.Containment:
Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent the spread of the ransomware. Disconnect from the internet, and segment the networks if necessary[5].
4.Eradication and Recovery:
Remove the ransomware from all infected systems following a verified clean-up procedure. Use trusted tools to clean infected systems and restore from backups after ensuring no traces of the ransomware remain[5].
5.Notification and Communication:
Notify internal stakeholders and, if required, external stakeholders such as regulatory bodies. Communicate with law enforcement and follow legal advice regarding any potential negotiations with attackers[1].
6.Post-Incident Review:
After the incident, conduct a thorough review to determine the cause of the breach, the effectiveness of the response, and update the incident response plan based on lessons learned. This step is essential for improving future security posture and response strategies[3].
