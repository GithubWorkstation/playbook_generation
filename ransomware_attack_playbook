1. Detection and Confirmation:
Implement intrusion detection systems to detect unusual network activity indicative of a ransomware attack.
Monitor system logs and alerts for signs of unauthorized access or file encryption.
Confirm the presence of ransomware through malware analysis tools and techniques.
2. Isolation and Containment:
Immediately isolate infected systems from the network to prevent the spread of ransomware.
Shut down affected servers and critical infrastructure components to contain the attack.
Disable remote access to compromised systems to prevent further unauthorized activity.
3. Notification and Activation:
Alert the incident response team, including IT security personnel, senior management, and relevant stakeholders.
Activate the organization's incident response plan and convene the incident response team for further coordination.
4. Assessment and Impact Analysis:
Assess the extent of the ransomware infection and its impact on critical infrastructure systems.
Identify the specific services and operations affected by the attack.
Evaluate the potential consequences of service disruption on public safety, health, and essential services.
5. Communication and Collaboration:
Establish clear lines of communication with internal teams, external partners, and relevant authorities.
Collaborate with law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, and cybersecurity experts to coordinate the response effort.
Communicate regularly with stakeholders to provide updates on the situation and mitigation efforts.
6. Data Recovery and Restoration:
Restore critical infrastructure systems and services from clean backups stored in offline or isolated environments.
Verify the integrity of restored data and ensure that no residual malware remains on the recovered systems.
Prioritize the restoration of essential services to minimize the impact on public safety and welfare.
7. Negotiation and Payment Consideration:
Evaluate the feasibility of negotiating with the attackers to obtain decryption keys and restore access to encrypted data.
Consult legal counsel and law enforcement agencies to assess the risks and legal implications of engaging with ransomware operators.
Consider the potential consequences of paying the ransom, including funding criminal activities and future targeting.
8. Prevention and Mitigation:
Conduct a comprehensive review of security controls and practices to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in defenses.
Implement additional security measures, such as network segmentation, endpoint protection, and user awareness training.
Update incident response plans and procedures based on lessons learned from the ransomware attack.
9. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting:
Comply with regulatory requirements regarding data breach notification and reporting.
Notify regulatory agencies, government authorities, and affected stakeholders as required by law.
Cooperate with law enforcement investigations and provide necessary information to support criminal prosecution efforts.
10. Aftermath and Lessons Learned:
Conduct a post-incident analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the response and identify areas for improvement.
Document lessons learned and best practices for future reference and training purposes.
Review insurance coverage and consider adjustments to coverage limits and policies based on the ransomware incident.
